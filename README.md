# Customer Revenue Optimizer

A comprehensive data science project that analyzes retail transaction data to identify at-risk customers and simulate the ROI of targeted retention campaigns. This project demonstrates proficiency in data engineering, customer segmentation using RFM analysis, and business intelligence for marketing optimization.

##  Project Overview

The Customer Revenue Optimizer project enables businesses to:
- **Identify Customer Segments**: Classify customers into actionable segments (Champions, Loyal, At Risk, Lost, etc.) using RFM analysis
- **Predict Churn Risk**: Identify customers at risk of leaving based on purchasing behavior patterns
- **Simulate Campaign ROI**: Calculate the potential return on investment for targeted discount campaigns
- **Optimize Marketing Spend**: Make data-driven decisions about customer retention strategies

##  Business Impact

This analysis helps businesses:
- **Reduce Customer Churn**: Proactively identify and engage at-risk customers before they leave
- **Maximize ROI**: Target marketing campaigns to customer segments with the highest potential return
- **Optimize Budget Allocation**: Understand the cost and benefit of retention campaigns before execution
- **Increase Customer Lifetime Value**: Retain valuable customers through strategic interventions

### Projected ROI Example
For the "At Risk" segment, a targeted 15% discount campaign with a 30% conversion rate can yield significant returns by retaining customers who might otherwise churn.

##  Visualizations

### Customer Segment Distribution

![Customer Segment Distribution](segment_distribution.png)

This bar chart visualizes the distribution of customers across different segments identified through RFM analysis. The chart shows seven distinct customer segments, ordered by size:

- **Need Attention** (1,194 customers, 27.52%): The largest segment, representing customers with mixed RFM scores requiring personalized engagement strategies
- **Champions** (953 customers, 21.97%): High-value customers with strong recency, frequency, and monetary scores - the best customers who should be kept engaged
- **Lost** (827 customers, 19.06%): Customers with low R, F, and M scores who have effectively churned
- **At Risk** (461 customers, 10.63%): Customers with low recency but moderate frequency and monetary values - critical segment requiring immediate retention efforts
- **Promising** (382 customers, 8.81%): Customers with moderate recency but low frequency - growing customers with potential
- **New Customers** (282 customers, 6.50%): Recent customers with high recency but low frequency and monetary scores
- **Loyal** (239 customers, 5.51%): Regular customers with high frequency and monetary values but moderate recency

This visualization helps identify the relative size and importance of each segment for targeted marketing strategies.

### Revenue Comparison: At Risk Segment

![Revenue Comparison](revenue_comparison.png)

This comparison chart demonstrates the potential revenue impact of a targeted retention campaign on the "At Risk" segment. The visualization compares:

- **Current Revenue** ($758,784): The total revenue currently generated by customers in the "At Risk" segment
- **Potential Revenue After Campaign** ($918,129): The projected revenue after implementing a 15% discount campaign with a 30% conversion rate

The chart highlights a **Net ROI of $159,345 (466.7%)**, showing that targeted intervention can significantly improve revenue recovery from at-risk customers. This visualization enables data-driven decision-making by clearly demonstrating the financial impact of retention campaigns.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prepare your data**:
   - Ensure your transaction data is saved as `data.csv` in the project root
   - Required columns: `InvoiceNo`, `StockCode`, `Description`, `Quantity`, `InvoiceDate`, `UnitPrice`, `CustomerID`, `Country`
   - If your file has a different name, update the `data_path` parameter in `analysis.py`

### Running the Analysis

Execute the complete pipeline:

```bash
python analysis.py
```

This will:
1. Load and clean the transaction data
2. Calculate RFM metrics (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) using DuckDB
3. Segment customers based on RFM scores
4. Generate visualizations:
   - Customer segment distribution
   - Revenue comparison for "At Risk" segment
5. Display ROI simulation results

##  RFM Analysis Explained

### RFM Metrics

- **Recency (R)**: Days since last purchase (lower is better)
  - Score 5: Most recent customers
  - Score 1: Least recent customers

- **Frequency (F)**: Total number of transactions
  - Score 5: Most frequent purchasers
  - Score 1: Least frequent purchasers

- **Monetary (M)**: Total revenue from customer
  - Score 5: Highest value customers
  - Score 1: Lowest value customers

### Customer Segments

- **Champions**: High R, F, M scores - Best customers, keep them engaged
- **Loyal**: High F and M, moderate R - Regular customers, maintain loyalty
- **At Risk**: Low R, moderate F and M - Need immediate attention to prevent churn
- **Lost**: Low R, F, M scores - Customers who have churned
- **New Customers**: High R, low F - Recent customers with potential
- **Promising**: Moderate R, low F - Growing customers
- **Need Attention**: Mixed scores - Require personalized approach

##  Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from analysis import RevenueOptimizer

# Initialize optimizer
optimizer = RevenueOptimizer(data_path='data.csv')

# Run complete pipeline
optimizer.load_data()
optimizer.clean_data()
optimizer.calculate_rfm_metrics()
optimizer.create_segments()

# Generate visualizations
optimizer.plot_segment_distribution('segment_distribution.png')
optimizer.plot_revenue_comparison('At Risk', discount_pct=15.0, 
                                 conversion_rate=0.3,
                                 save_path='revenue_comparison.png')

# Close connection
optimizer.close()
```

### ROI Simulation

```python
# Simulate ROI for a retention campaign
roi_results = optimizer.simulate_discount_roi(
    segment_name='At Risk',
    discount_pct=15.0,      # 15% discount
    conversion_rate=0.3      # 30% expected conversion
)

print(f"Net ROI: ${roi_results['net_roi']:,.2f}")
print(f"ROI Percentage: {roi_results['roi_percentage']:.2f}%")
```
